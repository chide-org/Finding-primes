# Finding-primes

An interesting project that will run on a server for at least 1 year, constantly looking for prime numbers


#### If you are interested in the project, you can join me and:

- Provide me with efficient **algorithms**, or **analyse** the data obtained (If you're the big man).

- Help me **manage** my resources (If you have much time).

- Just give me a **star** (If you just look).

Anyway, thanks for your interest.
